# Mild High Club

## Description

Mild High Club is a simple tool that allows you to search for airports within a state, and check on the weather forecast for that area. 
All of the participants creating this project have had negative experiences with weather on trips out of town, and wanted to create a tool to help keep others in the know so it can lessen that outcome on people.
As a person that wants to travel often, I can search quickly for airports in an area and get the weather forecast so that I am not running headlong into less-than-desirable climate.
The project faced us with the challenges of API calls and we learned how to overcome the challenges that pop up in those types of calls.
